## My core philosophies - Tenants for success in an ever-evolving technological world:
1. **"No pressure. No diamonds."** [Thomas Carlyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Carlyle) Nothing good comes without challenges - embrace them and learn from them. They will only make you better.  
2. **Humility** - you do nothing in this world by yourself. Everything you've done came with some support from individuals or groups. Recognize it and don't overestimate your capabilities as a loner. 
3. **Empathy** - we are all humans and going through something at some point time. Work on Emotional Intelligence (EQ) to recognize and internalize what others are experiencing.  
4. **"Only mediocre people are perfect all the time."** No matter what the goals or experience are, we all fumble with these once in a while and forgiveness/understanding should be part of your core values for when you're on the receiving end.  
5. **Trust** is the most important factor in relationships. Without trust,  it's a zero-sum game. Be open and honest. FULL STOP.  Trust is like a sheet of paper: breaking that trust is like crumbling up the paper - you can smooth it out and go on but it will never be the same.  
6. **Communicate EFFECTIVELY** - there is such a thing as over communicating and feedback is a critical element of communication, especially in project management; no one can read minds, if you don't communicate your thoughts/feelings, nothing will get accomplished. (Hold Ask Me Anythings; anonymous feedback forms) 
7. **There is no such thing as multi-tasking** - there is only switch-tasking, which is a crime because it steals your productivity; the brain can only focus on ONE cognitive task at a time. PERIOD. There is no getting around this fact of nature. [Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow)
8. **"Better to remain silent and to be thought a fool than to open mouth and remove all doubt."** Abrahan Lincoln  
9. **Think like an entrepreneur** – what if this project was YOUR OWN SMALL BUSINESS? How  would you go about running things? What priorities would you identify and focus on? Take ownership and empower yourself.  
10. **"No plan survives first contact with the enemy."** [Battle Management Mantra.](https://www.google.com/search?q=no+plan+survives+first+contact+with+the+enemy&oq=no+plan+sur&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBwgAEAAYgAQyBwgAEAAYgAQyBwgBEAAYgAQyBggCEEUYOTIHCAMQABiABDIHCAQQABiABDIHCAUQABiABDIHCAYQABiABDIGCAcQRRg80gEIMjk1MWowajSoAgCwAgA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) A plan doesn’t need to be a super-detailed document - it only needs to list the desired outcomes, highlights of how to get there, and what are some fall backs if snags occur (risks/issues). Most details aren’t realized until the resistance presents itself, so it’s not worth the effort to spend valuable time on it too soon.   On the flip side – FAILURE TO PLAN EQUALS PLANNING TO FAIL! 
11. **Beware complacency** - Don’t rest on your past accomplishments - continue to challenge yourself effectively and embrace the friction. Lean into discomfort. "The only easy day was yesterday!" [Navy SEAL training mantra.] 
12. **There is no problem which cannot be overcome.** Complaining about a problem or scenario without offering a solution is just whining and that is unacceptable.
