# Employee Engagement Communications Recommendations

## Why do we need a communications plan?
- Communication is key in driving change throughout an organization, especially as it relates to incorporating new technologies, services, or processes.
- Structured communications inform users of an upcoming rollout, creates a sense of anticipation, brings people together, and increases confidence.

## Steps for Communications Plan Modeling
1.	Identify the Audiences
2.	Identify Key Messages & Timing
3.	Determine Delivery Method & Frequency
4.	Determine Sender
 
### Communications tips:
- Keep emails short and sweet, with a clear call to action.
- Communication should be sent from an individual not a group or distribution list.
- Answer questions such as “How does this help me do my job?” and “Why are we using this?”
- Enable two-way communication with users – provide a feedback channel.
- Host in-person events in high-traffic areas.

## Initial Communications
- Start with T-30 days from Go Live (see Comm Plan Table below)
- Initiated by the Executive Sponsor (employees want change comms from up high - see below breakout of personnel preferences)
- Can be an email, but include other material links - videos, web sites, etc.
- Include training details - why, when, where, who, how, or early view availability
- Start with the importance of 'why' ensuring that both the leadership and through them, the whole organization understands the importance of the program - vision/objectives:
  - Synergy
  - Easier Collaborative Working
  - Business Case itself - i.e. Mission
  - Goals
  - People Strategy
  - Enable Innovation

## Drive Awareness and Excitement
- Show 'what's in it for them'
- Clearly communicate the goal & milestones
- Tailor language & target the audience
- “If people understand how it’s going to help them, they will be more motivated to learn it.”

## Awareness Methods
Inform employees of upcoming rollouts, and share benefits for them to create anticipation:
- Teaser videos - a great way to generate buzz and get people excited; play teaser videos during events, before meetings/gatherings, or in common spaces
- Use scenario cards (use cases) - leverage re-usable guidance to demonstrate use cases for the new capability; ties back to 'what's in it for them'
- Print comms - colorful posters/flyers in common spaces or shared during meetings; sustain the momentum post-launch; <b>do not 'set it & forget it'</b>
- Buzz Day - a great way to showcase benefits, generate excitement, and involve Champions w/in the org
- With more virtual work than ever before, print communications may be less of a priority but should not be totally excluded; there will still be a need to post/share print materials with potential end users that would miss the digital communications

## Communication Tactics
Say it 5-7 times in different ways for it to truly sink in.
Utilize a variety of communication and training options:
| | |
|----|----|
| Executive Blogs | First Touch Events |
| Newsletters  | Desk Visits |
| Entry Comms | Early Adopter Videos |
| Teaser Comms | Podcasts |
| Promo videos | Posters |

## Personnel Preferred Senders of Change Messages (PROSCI research):
- CEO/President - 45%
- Executive Manager - 28%
- Senior Manager - 9%
- Department Head - 8%
- Change Management Team Member - ~5%
- Employee's Supervisor - 2% (compared to 67% for personal messages)
- Comms Specialist - 1%
- Project Team Member - >1%
- HR Representative - >1%

Demonstrates the importance of picking the right preferred sender: What if you saw a companywide email from your manager on the annual financial update? Or a call from the CEO discussing the change in your work duties? How would that feel? Where is the credibility of the Preferred sender?
