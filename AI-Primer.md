# What is AI? 

Simply put, AI is the creation of software that imitates human behaviors and capabilities. Key workloads include: 
- Machine learning - This is often the foundation for an AI system, and is the way we "teach" a computer model to make predictions and draw conclusions from data. 
- Anomaly detection - The capability to automatically detect errors or unusual activity in a system. 
- Computer vision - The capability of software to interpret the world visually through cameras, video, and images. 
- Natural language processing - The capability for a computer to interpret written or spoken language, and respond in kind. 
- Knowledge mining - The capability to extract information from large volumes of often unstructured data to create a searchable knowledge store.

Artificial Intelligence is a powerful tool that can be used to greatly benefit the world. However, like any tool, it must be used responsibly. 
The following table shows some of the potential challenges and risks facing an AI application developer. 
|Challenge or Risk | Example |
|------------------|------------|
| Bias can affect results | A loan-approval model discriminates by gender due to bias in the data with which it was trained |
|Errors may cause harm  | An autonomous vehicle experiences a system failure and causes a collision |
| Data could be exposed | A medical diagnostic bot is trained using sensitive patient data, which is stored insecurely |
| Solutions may not work for everyone | A home automation assistant provides no audio output for visually impaired users |
| Users must trust a complex system | An AI-based financial tool makes investment recommendations - what are they based on? |
| Who's liable for AI-driven decisions? | An innocent person is convicted of a crime based on evidence from facial recognition – who's responsible? |

Usage of Azure OpenAI should follow the six Microsoft AI principles: 
- Fairness: AI systems shouldn't make decisions that discriminate against or support bias of a group or individual. 
- Reliability and Safety: AI systems should respond safely to new situations and potential manipulation. 
- Privacy and Security: AI systems should be secure and respect data privacy. 
- Inclusiveness: AI systems should empower everyone and engage people. 
- Accountability: People must be accountable for how AI systems operate. 
- Transparency: AI systems should have explanations so users can understand how they're built and used.
