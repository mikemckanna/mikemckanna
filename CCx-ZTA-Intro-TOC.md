	• CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/zero-trust/cisa-zero-trust-maturity-model-intro>

Since released, Microsoft has updated and offered product advancements which support the customers' needs through manual activities, but primarily in automation/AI activities.
